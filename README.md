Evidence from clinical trials suggests that CXCR4 antagonists enhance immunotherapy effectiveness in several cancers. However, the specific mechanisms through which CXCR4 contributes to immune cell phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we employed single-cell transcriptomic analysis across over 1.3 million cells and identified CXCR4 as a marker gene in T cells, with CD8+ PD-1high exhausted T (Tex) cells exhibiting high CXCR4 expression. By targeting CXCR4, the Tex phenotype was attenuated in vivo. Mechanistically, CXCR4-blocking T cells mitigated the Tex phenotype via regulating the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Single-cell RNA/TCR/ATAC-seq confirmed that CXCR4-deficient CD8+ T cells epigenetically mitigated the transition from a functional to an exhausted phenotype. Notably, preliminary analysis of the clinical trial (NCT04516616) revealed that CXCR4+ CD8+ T cells showed higher expression in patients with a non-complete pathological response. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the mechanism by which CXCR4 orchestrates CD8+ Tex cells and provide a rationale for combining CXCR4 antagonists with immunotherapy in clinical trials.
