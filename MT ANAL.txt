Multiple deconvolution-based analyses of CXCR4 expression in immune cells were performed using GEPIA2021 (33). We used the sub-expression analysis tool to visualize the CXCR4 expression in each immune cell type, which determines the cell type-level differential expression of CXCR4 in immune cells. Differential expression analysis of gene expression levels was performed using ANOVA. Using the deconvolution strategy, we can unlock valuable cell type information, enabling us to investigate the relationship between cell proportions. Utilizing the deconvolution results, we can compare the proportions of various cell types and calculate and compare CXCR4 expression in bulk samples contributed by these distinct cell types.
